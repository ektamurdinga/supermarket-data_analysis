Project Name: Supermarket Data_Analysis

Objective:
Supermarket chains or individual stores are the targeted audience.They could use it to manage their chain of stores and maintain clear records and analyse their sales and increase their profit. 
Since everything is online it would be convenient to sync all the data across various stores at different locations.

Summary: 
Supermarket management system is the system where all the aspects related to the proper management of supermarkets are done. 
These aspects involve managing information about the various products, staff, managers, customers, billing etc. 
This system provides an efficient way of managing the supermarket information. Also allows the customer to purchase and pay for the items purchased.
This project is based on the sales transaction and billing of items in a supermarket. 
The first activity is based on adding the items to the system along with the rate which are present in the supermarket and the name of the items which the supermarket will agree to sell. 
This authority is given only to the product manager. Any modifications to be done in the item name and the rate can be done only by him. He also has the right to delete any item. 
As the customer buys the products and comes to the billing counter, the user is supposed to enter the item name he purchased and the quantity of the item he had purchased.
