2.Who purchased more , men or women in 2022 ?

3.What are different order statuses ?

4.Which are the top 10 states contributing to sales?

  lowest. Additionally, there is a noticeable decline 
   in sales and order quantities after March.


2.Women are more likely to purchase (69%) than men.


3.In my dataset, the different order statuses are primarily categorized as:

  92.25% of orders are marked as "Delivered".
  The remaining percentage consists of orders that are "Cancelled", "Refunded," or "Returned".
