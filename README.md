Super Market Data Analysis

Introduction :
The "Supermarket Sales Analysis" project was undertaken with the objective of assisting the store in generating a comprehensive annual sales report, understanding customer behavior, and enhancing overall customer sales. The project involved a series of tasks, including gaining insights into the data, cleaning and preprocessing the data, conducting in-depth analyses, creating visual representations, and compiling a detailed report. The primary focus was on uncovering patterns in customer behavior that could be leveraged to boost sales. The project encompassed a thorough exploration of the data, ensuring its accuracy and completeness, followed by advanced analytics and the creation of informative visualizations. The ultimate goal is to provide the store with actionable insights that can drive strategic decisions and contribute to the growth and optimization of sales operations.

This project includes steps as follows :

The project also answered important questions such as :-

What are different order statuses ?
Which are the top 10 states contributing to sales?
What is the relation between age and gender based on the number of orders?
Which channel is contributing maximum sales ?

Based on the report insights ,here are the outcomes of the sales :-
In my report, I found that March has the highest sales and order numbers, while November has the lowest. Additionally, there is a noticeable decline in sales and order quantities after March.

Women are more likely to purchase (69%) than men.

In my dataset, the different order statuses are primarily categorized as:

92.25% of orders are marked as "Delivered".
The remaining percentage consists of orders that are "Cancelled", "Refunded," or "Returned".
Top 10 states :

The adult age group (30-49 yrs) made the most contributions.

Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels were the top contributors.

The 'Set' clothing category received the highest number of orders, comprising 40% of the total.
